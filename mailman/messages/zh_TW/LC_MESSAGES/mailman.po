"These policies control the automatic bounce processing system\n"
"            in Mailman.  Here's an overview of how it works.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>When a bounce is received, Mailman tries to extract two "
"pieces\n"
"            of information from the message: the address of the member the\n"
"            message was intended for, and the severity of the problem "
"causing\n"
"            the bounce.  The severity can be either <em>hard</em> or\n"
"            <em>soft</em> meaning either a fatal error occurred, or a\n"
"            transient error occurred.  When in doubt, a hard severity is "
"used.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>If no member address can be extracted from the bounce, then "
"the\n"
"            bounce is usually discarded.  Otherwise, each member is assigned "
"a\n"
"            <em>bounce score</em> and every time we encounter a bounce from\n"
"            this member we increment the score.  Hard bounces increment by "
"1\n"
"            while soft bounces increment by 0.5.  We only increment the "
"bounce\n"
"            score once per day, so even if we receive ten hard bounces from "
"a\n"
"            member per day, their score will increase by only 1 for that "
"day.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>When a member's bounce score is greater than the\n"
"            <a href=\"?VARHELP=bounce/bounce_score_threshold\">bounce score\n"
"            threshold</a>, the subscription is disabled.  Once disabled, "
"the\n"
"            member will not receive any postings from the list until their\n"
"            membership is explicitly re-enabled (either by the list\n"
"            administrator or the user).  However, they will receive "
"occasional\n"
"            reminders that their membership has been disabled, and these\n"
"            reminders will include information about how to re-enable their\n"
"            membership.\n"

"            >frequency</a> with which these reminders are sent.\n"
"\n"
"            <p>There is one other important configuration variable; after a\n"

"General framework for interacting with a mailing list object.\n"
"\n"
"There are two ways to use this script: interactively or programmatically.\n"
"Using it interactively allows you to play with, examine and modify a "
"MailList\n"
"object from Python's interactive interpreter.  When running interactively, "
"a\n"
"MailList object called `m' will be available in the global namespace.  It "
"also\n"
"loads the class MailList into the global namespace.\n"
"\n"
"Programmatically, you can write a function to operate on a MailList object,\n"
"and this script will take care of the housekeeping (see below for "
"examples).\n"
"In that case, the general usage syntax is:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist [options] listname [args ...]\n"
"\n"
"Options:\n"
"\n"
"    -l / --lock\n"
"        Lock the list when opening.  Normally the list is opened unlocked\n"
"        (e.g. for read-only operations).  You can always lock the file "
"after\n"
"        the fact by typing `m.Lock()'\n"
"\n"
"        Note that if you use this option, you should explicitly call m.Save"
"()\n"
"        before exiting, since the interpreter's clean up procedure will not\n"
"        automatically save changes to the MailList object (but it will "
"unlock\n"
"        the list).\n"
"\n"
"    -i / --interactive\n"
"        Leaves you at an interactive prompt after all other processing is\n"
"        complete.  This is the default unless the -r option is given.\n"
"\n"
"    --run [module.]callable\n"
"    -r [module.]callable\n"
"        This can be used to run a script with the opened MailList object.\n"
"        This works by attempting to import `module' (which must be in the\n"
"        directory containing withlist, or already be accessible on your\n"
"        sys.path), and then calling `callable' from the module.  callable "
"can\n"
"        be a class or function; it is called with the MailList object as "
"the\n"
"        first argument.  If additional args are given on the command line,\n"
"        they are passed as subsequent positional args to the callable.\n"
"\n"
"        Note that `module.' is optional; if it is omitted then a module "
"with\n"
"        the name `callable' will be imported.\n"
"\n"
"        The global variable `r' will be set to the results of this call.\n"
"\n"
"    --all / -a\n"
"        This option only works with the -r option.  Use this if you want to\n"
"        execute the script on all mailing lists.  When you use -a you "
"should\n"
"        not include a listname argument on the command line.  The variable "
"`r'\n"
"        will be a list of all the results.\n"
"\n"
"    --quiet / -q\n"
"        Suppress all status messages.\n"
"\n"
"    --help / -h\n"
"        Print this message and exit\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"Here's an example of how to use the -r option.  Say you have a file in the\n"
"Mailman installation directory called `listaddr.py', with the following\n"
"two functions:\n"
"\n"
"def listaddr(mlist):\n"
"    print mlist.GetListEmail()\n"
"\n"
"def requestaddr(mlist):\n"
"    print mlist.GetRequestEmail()\n"
"\n"
"Now, from the command line you can print the list's posting address by "
"running\n"
"the following from the command line:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist -r listaddr mylist\n"
"Loading list: mylist (unlocked)\n"
"Importing listaddr ...\n"
"Running listaddr.listaddr() ...\n"
"mylist@myhost.com\n"
"\n"
"And you can print the list's request address by running:\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist -r listaddr.requestaddr mylist\n"
"Loading list: mylist (unlocked)\n"
"Importing listaddr ...\n"
"Running listaddr.requestaddr() ...\n"
"mylist-request@myhost.com\n"
"\n"
"As another example, say you wanted to change the password for a particular\n"
"user on a particular list.  You could put the following function in a file\n"
"called `changepw.py':\n"
"\n"
"from Mailman.Errors import NotAMemberError\n"
"\n"
"def changepw(mlist, addr, newpasswd):\n"
"    try:\n"
"        mlist.setMemberPassword(addr, newpasswd)\n"
"        mlist.Save()\n"
"    except NotAMemberError:\n"

"和郵遞論壇物件作用的一般框架。\n"
"\n"
"這個手稿有兩種用法：交談式或以程式叫用。\n"
"交談式的用法可以讓你在 python 的交談式直譯器中玩弄、檢視和修改 MailList 物"
"件。\n"
"當以交談式執行時，名為 `m' 的 MailList 物件會出現在全域命名空間中，\n"
"MailList 這個類別也會被載入全域命名空間中。\n"
"以程式叫用時，您可以寫個操作 MailList 物件的函式，這個手稿會幫您把內務管好"
"（見以下的範例）。\n"
"在那個情形下，一般使用的語法是：\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist 〔選項〕 listname 〔引數  ...〕\n"
"\n"
"選項：\n"
"\n"
" -l / --lock\n"
" 在開啟論壇時上鎖。通常是不上鎖的（也就是唯讀的操作）。您還是可以用 m.Lock() "
"在事後上鎖。\n"
" 請注意，因為直譯器的清除（clean up）程序不會自動回存 MailList 物件，但會解開"
"論壇的鎖，如果您使用這個選項，在離開前記得要明確地呼叫 m.Save()。 -i / --"
"interactive\n"
" 在所有程序都執行完畢後，將您留在交談式環境中。\n"
" 這是預設的動作，除非您指定了 -r 選項。\n"
"\n"
" --run [module.]callable\n"
" -r [module.]callable\n"
" 這可用來執行含有打開的 MailList 物件的手稿。\n"
" 它會載入 `module' 這個模組，再呼叫模組中 `callable' 這個函式。\n"
" 模組必須是在 withlist 的目錄或在 python 的 sys.path 中，而 callable\n"
" 可以是函式也可以是類別，但第一個引數必須接受 MailList 物件。\n"
" 如果命令列中有其他引數，它們會以位置引數旳方式傳入 callable。\n"
"\n"
" 請注意：`module.' 可以不給；如果沒給的話，會先載入名為 `callable' 的模組。\n"
"\n"
" 這個呼叫的結果會放在廣域變數 `r' 中。\n"
"\n"
" --all / -a\n"
" 這個選項必須和 -r 搭配使用，如果您想在所有論壇上使用這個手稿才用這個選項。"
"用 -a 時請不要給定論壇名稱。變數 `r' 會存有所有論壇的執行結果的清單。\n"
"\n"
" --quiet / -q\n"
" 抑制所有的狀態訊息。\n"
"\n"
" --help / -h\n"
" 印出這個訊息然後離開。\n"
"\n"
"\n"
"以下是個使用 -r 選項的範例。假如您在 Mailman 安裝目錄中有個叫做 `listaddr."
"py' 的檔案，其中有兩個函式：\n"
"\n"
"def listaddr(mlist):\n"
" print mlist.GetListEmail()\n"
"\n"
"def requestaddr(mlist):\n"
" print mlist.GetRequestEmail()\n"
"\n"
"那您就可以從命令列印出論壇的刊登地址了：\n"
"%% bin/withlist -r listaddr mylist\n"
"Loading list: mylist (unlocked)\n"
"Importing listaddr ...\n"
"Running listaddr.listaddr() ...\n"
"mylist@myhost.com\n"
"\n"
"您也可以印出論壇的 request 地址：\n"
"\n"
"%% bin/withlist -r listaddr.requestaddr mylist\n"
"Loading list: mylist (unlocked)\n"
"Importing listaddr ...\n"
"Running listaddr.requestaddr() ...\n"
"mylist-request@myhost.com\n"
"\n"
"再來一個範例：假如您想改變某個論壇的某個訂戶的密碼，您可以把下列函式放在一個"
"叫做 `changepw.py' 的檔案：\n"
"\n"
"from Mailman.Errors import NotAMemberError\n"
"\n"
"def changepw(mlist, addr, newpasswd):\n"
" try:\n"
" mlist.setMemberPassword(addr, newpasswd)\n"
" mlist.Save()\n"
" except NotAMemberError:\n"
" print 'No address matched:', addr\n"
